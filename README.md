# CS3338 Final Project
The Lunar Rocks! Supports NASA’s goal of having a long-term presence on the Moon by helping map and study what the Moon is made of and where important resources are located. It also invites the public to take part, so citizen scientists can use interactive tools to help map and classify lunar rocks, making Moon exploration more accessible.
